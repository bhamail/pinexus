GitHub Actions Notes
====================

Local Builds
---------------
You can locally test the GitHub Actions defined in this directory using [nektos act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

This allows you to run an equivalent CI build on your local machine. For example:
```console
    $ act
    ...
    [Run Link Tests/build]   ‚úÖ  Success - Main Run Tests
    [Run Link Tests/build] üèÅ  Job succeeded
```
A failed CI build will resemble this:
```console
    $ act
    ...
    | domain failed: links.sonatype.com
    | make: *** [Makefile:38: test] Error 1
    [Run Link Tests/build]   ‚ùå  Failure - Main Run Tests
    [Run Link Tests/build] exitcode '2': failure
    [Run Link Tests/build] üèÅ  Job failed
    Error: Job 'build' failed
```
Note: The first time you run [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), it can take a long time (with no output) to download
the various docker goodies. Give it time before deciding it is stuck.

If running on Apple silicon, and you see docker errors, try launching act with this flag:
```console
   act --container-architecture linux/amd64
```
Without this flag, I saw this warning:
```console
WARN  ‚ö† You are using Apple M-series chip and you have not specified container architecture, you might encounter issues while running act. If so, try running it with '--container-architecture linux/amd64'. ‚ö†
```
and this error:
```console
[Run Link Tests/build] ‚≠ê Run Main Run Tests
[Run Link Tests/build]   üê≥  docker exec cmd=[bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail /var/run/act/workflow/1] user= workdir=

```

### Rancher Desktop on Mac

If you are using Rancher Desktop on Mac, you may see errors like this:

```bash
%  act -j build 
INFO[0000] Using docker host 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock', and daemon socket 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock' 
[Build Website/build] üöÄ  Start image=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04
[Build Website/build]   üê≥  docker pull image=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04 platform= username= forcePull=true
Error: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```
You can print out your Docker contexts with the following command:
```bash
% docker context ls
NAME                DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT                         ERROR
default             Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock             
rancher-desktop *   Rancher Desktop moby context              unix:///Users/bhamail/.rd/docker.sock   
```
You can set the DOCKER_HOST environment variable as shown below which will allow `act` to use the correct Docker context:
```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=$(docker context inspect | jq -r '.[0].Endpoints.docker.Host')
```
