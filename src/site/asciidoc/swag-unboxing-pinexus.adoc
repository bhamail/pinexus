 . The Pi will boot up when you connect the USB Power cable, and display startup messages on the connected
   monitor. One of the last messages shown during startup is the Pi IP Address, a few lines before the login prompt:
+
----
My IP Address is x.x.x.x

Raspian GNU/Linux 7 raspberrypi tty1

raspberrypi login: _
----
+
  . Use this IP Address to connect to the Pi via `ssh`. The default userId is `pi`, and password is `raspberry`.
+
----
my-pc$ ssh pi@the-Pi-IP-address

You can use this IP Address to connect to Nexus running on the Pi. The default Nexus administrator credentials
are user: `admin`, password: `admin123`.
